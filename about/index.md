# About me


# Background
Hey there! My name is Huynh Luu Vinh Phong, the author of this page. I am currently a final year student at [University of Science Ho Chi Minh City](https://en.hcmus.edu.vn/), majoring in Data Science. My love for math and solving problems is what first got me interested in data, but over time, I discovered that coding is what truly excites me. Now, my goal is to become a **Data Engineer**, where I can work with data everyday and turn it into something meaningful.

# Learning is a journey
The world of data is huge, indeed. And I am just at the beginning of my journey. I enjoy learning new things and diving deeper into data tools and technologies. Every day is a chance to grow and explore more of this exciting field, and I’m ready to take on the challenges ahead. There is a quote that motivate me during my journey:

> __The most beautiful thing about learning is that no one can take it away from you__

This quote is about the power of learning is truly your inside power and your instinct. Therefore, no one can take it away from you. And going along with the ability to learn more, you will have the power to change the world.

When I’m not busy with school or coding, I enjoy playing badminton and getting lost in anime or manga. I’ve always been fascinated by Japanese culture, and exploring it through anime is one of my favorite ways to unwind. I believe that learning is a lifelong journey, and I’m always eager to pick up new skills, whether it’s in data science or in my personal hobbies.

To me, learning isn’t just about getting better grades or landing a job—it’s about shaping my future. I truly believe that by continuously learning, I can create the life I want and make an impact in the world of data. And that’s what keeps me motivated every day.
